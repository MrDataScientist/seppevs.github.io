I'm a freelance software developer with 10 years of experience in Java enterprise application development.

Since early 2014, I'm exploring the wonderful world of Node.js and JavaScript.

I always had a very broad interest in computer technology, so I probably won't blog only on Node.js & JavaScript.

I have a wife and two kids, and I live in Belgium.
